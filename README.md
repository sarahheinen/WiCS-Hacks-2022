# WiCS-Hacks-2022

# This is a project I made for WiCS Hacks 2022
# This game is based on the duck matching game you typically see at a carnival or fair
# In this game, there are rubber ducks with numbers on the bottom floating in a small pool
# The player chooses two ducks. If the numbers on the bottom match, the player wins
# This Python text-based game has 25 “ducks” to choose from, each with a number on the “bottom”
# The player in this game has three chances to win

# Different assigned prizes are based on the number on the “bottom” of your “ducks”
# Higher numbers are more rare, and therefore have better prizes
# The game does not allow you to enter a letter or a number outside the range when prompted
# Each game re-randomizes the numbers on the bottom of the ducks, allowing for a new fun game each time!
